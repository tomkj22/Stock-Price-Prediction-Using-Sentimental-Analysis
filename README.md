# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-Sentimental-Analysis
# Roadmap
### 1. **Define Project Goals**

- [x] Specific objectives : predicting stock prices based on sentiment from tweets.

### 2. **Data Collection**

- [x] **Stock Price Data**: Collecting dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/taufiquesekh/stock-sentiment-analysis/input)

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**

- [x] **Stock Price Data**:
  - [x] Clean and format data (handle missing values, normalize prices).
- [x] **Textual Data**:
  - [x] Clean text (remove punctuation, stopwords, etc.).
  - [x] Tokenize and encode text using BERT's tokenizer.
  - [x] Create sentiment labels if necessary (positive, negative, neutral).

### 4. **Sentiment Analysis with BERT**

- [x] **Model Selection**: Choose a pre- [ ]trained BERT model (e.g., `bert- [ ]base- [ ]uncased`).
- [x] **Fine- [ ]Tuning**:
  - [x] Fine- [ ]tune BERT on this dataset to classify sentiment.
- [ ] **Feature Extraction**: Generate sentiment scores for the collected textual data.

### 5. **Model Training for Stock Price Prediction**

- [ ] **Split Data**: Divide your stock price data into training and test sets.
- [ ] **Feature Engineering**: Integrate sentiment scores from BERT with stock price features.
- [ ] **Model Training**:
  - [ ] **XGBoost**: Train an XGBoost model on the training set.
  - [ ] **LSTM**: Prepare sequences for LSTM and train the model.
  - [ ] **Random Forest**: Train a Random Forest model using the combined features.
- [ ] **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search for optimal model parameters.

### 6. **Model Evaluation**

- [ ] Evaluate each model using appropriate metrics (RMSE, MAE).
- [ ] Compare performance and select the best models.
- [ ] Assess the importance of sentiment features in predictions.

### 7. **Ensemble Model Creation**

- [ ] Combine predictions from XGBoost, LSTM, and Random Forest (e.g., via stacking or averaging).
- [ ] Test the ensemble model's performance against individual models.

### 8. **Deployment Preparation**

- [ ] **Environment Setup**: Prepare a deployment environment (e.g., Docker, virtual environments).
- [ ] **Model Serialization**: Save the trained models using libraries like `joblib` or `pickle`.

### 9. **Web Application Development**

- [ ] **Choose a Framework**: Decide on a web framework (e.g., Flask or Django).
- [ ] **Build APIs**: Create RESTful APIs to serve model predictions.
  - [ ] Endpoint to accept stock tickers and related text.
  - [ ] Endpoint to return predicted prices and sentiment scores.
- [ ] **Frontend Development**: Develop a user- [ ]friendly frontend (e.g., using HTML/CSS/JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js).
- [ ] **Integrate Models**: Connect your web app to the ensemble model to fetch predictions.

### 10. **Testing**

- [ ] Conduct thorough testing of the web application (unit tests, integration tests).
- [ ] Ensure the models return accurate predictions and handle various inputs.
